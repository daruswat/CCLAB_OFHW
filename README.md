My OF final project is the file named FINALOF_7.

Project name : LITTLE THREEPIG AND MEAN WOLF

My goal of this project is to create a story and scene base on tale. 

My story is about wolf and three pigs that try to skip away from wolf. The wolf is so tricky because before the wolf moves, the wolf
pretend to be a sheep but once the wolf comes close to pig it will change to mean wolf. This situation happen in the snow fall day. 
As we know the wolf blow pigs' house away so snow fall shows that the wolf try to harm these three pigs. Where ever the wolf goes, 
it will blow. Strings show that three pigs can't go any where because of the they feel attach to their house even if it is dangerous.

I try to use the code run on raspberry pi but it is not working Also the scene that I did I want to do more in details.

What I used : Sound, OpenGL, Raspberry pi

Reference:
 1. sound command I found example online.
 2. OpenGL I followed the leason from the CCLab class because I want to understand more about hoe to code before I go to another step.
 3. snow drop backgroung I use example from Openframeworks and modify color speed and the way snow fall, etc.
